PROJECT TITLE: Unit 2 Program
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
VERSION or DATE:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Taylor Thompson and Sydney Lohman
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Taylor I hope that you are reading this: I am pretty sure that I've got most of the work done, 
except I am not sure if it is printing its work or not. If you can make sure that it is and if the program
isn't, then can you figure out a way to print it? I am planning to work on it over the weekend, but before that I'm not sure 
if I have the time. Other than the possible printing problem everything should be done.

Yes I know that it looks different, I had to do some research to get some help.

        Wow didn't really expect this to be this long,
            -Sydney Lohman
